`|Build Status| <https://travis-ci.org/rags/pynt>`_

A pynt of Python build.
=======================

`Raghunandan Rao <https://github.com/rags>`_

Features
--------

-  Easy to learn.
-  Build tasks are just python funtions.
-  Manages dependencies between tasks.
-  Automatically generates a command line interface.
-  Rake style param passing to tasks
-  Supports python 2.7 and python 3.x

Installation
------------

You can install pynt from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or from
source.

Using pip

::

    $ pip install pynt

Using easy\_install

::

    $ easy_install pynt

Example
-------

The build script is written in pure Python and pynt takes care of
managing any dependencies between tasks and generating a command line
interface.

Writing build tasks is really simple, all you need to know is the @task
decorator. Tasks are just regular Python functions marked with the
``@task()`` decorator. Dependencies are specified with ``@task()`` too.
Tasks can be ignored with the ``@task(ignore=True)``. Disabling a task
is an useful feature to have in situations where you have one task that
a lot of other tasks depend on and you want to quickly remove it from
the dependency chains of all the dependent tasks.

**build.py**
------------

::


    #!/usr/bin/python

    import sys
    from pynt import task

    @task()
    def clean():
        '''Clean build directory.'''
        print 'Cleaning build directory...'

    @task(clean)
    def html(target='.'):
        '''Generate HTML.'''
        print 'Generating HTML in directory "%s"' %  target

    @task(clean, ignore=True)
    def images():
        '''Prepare images.'''
        print 'Preparing images...'

    @task(html,images)
    def start_server(server='localhost', port = '80'):
        '''Start the server'''
        print 'Starting server at %s:%s' % (server, port)

    @task(start_server) #Depends on task with all optional params
    def stop_server():
        print 'Stopping server....'

    @task()
    def copy_file(src, dest):
        print 'Copying from %s to %s' % (src, dest)

    @task()
    def echo(*args,**kwargs):
        print args
        print kwargs

    # Default task (if specified) is run when no task is specified in the command line
    # make sure you define the variable __DEFAULT__ after the task is defined
    # A good convention is to define it at the end of the module
    # __DEFAULT__ is an optional member

    __DEFAULT__=start_server

**Running pynt tasks**
----------------------

The command line interface and help is automatically generated. Task
descriptions are extracted from function docstrings.

::

    $ pynt -h
    usage: pynt [-h] [-l] [-v] [-f file] [task [task ...]]

    positional arguments:
      task                  perform specified task and all its dependencies

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -l, --list-tasks      List the tasks
      -v, --version         Display the version information
      -f file, --file file  Build file to read the tasks from. Default is
                            'build.py'

::

    $ pynt -l
    Tasks in build file ./build.py:
      clean                       Clean build directory.
      copy_file                   
      echo                        
      html                        Generate HTML.
      images           [Ignored]  Prepare images.
      start_server     [Default]  Start the server
      stop_server                 

    Powered by pynt - A Lightweight Python Build Tool.

pynt takes care of dependencies between tasks. In the following case
start\_server depends on clean, html and image generation (image task is
ignored).

::

    $ pynt #Runs the default task start_server. It does exactly what "pynt start_server" would do.
    [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
    Cleaning build directory...
    [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "html" ]
    Generating HTML in directory "."
    [ example.py - Completed task "html" ]
    [ example.py - Ignoring task "images" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "start_server" ]
    Starting server at localhost:80
    [ example.py - Completed task "start_server" ]

The first few characters of the task name is enough to execute the task,
as long as the partial name is unambigious. You can specify multiple
tasks to run in the commandline. Again the dependencies are taken taken
care of.

::

    $ pynt cle ht cl
    [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
    Cleaning build directory...
    [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "html" ]
    Generating HTML in directory "."
    [ example.py - Completed task "html" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
    Cleaning build directory...
    [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]

The 'html' task dependency 'clean' is run only once. But clean can be
explicitly run again later.

pynt tasks can accept parameters from commandline.

::

    $ pynt "copy_file[/path/to/foo, path_to_bar]"
    [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
    Cleaning build directory...
    [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "copy_file" ]
    Copying from /path/to/foo to path_to_bar
    [ example.py - Completed task "copy_file" ]

pynt can also accept keyword arguments.

::

    $ pynt start[port=8888]
    [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
    Cleaning build directory...
    [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "html" ]
    Generating HTML in directory "."
    [ example.py - Completed task "html" ]
    [ example.py - Ignoring task "images" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "start_server" ]
    Starting server at localhost:8888
    [ example.py - Completed task "start_server" ]

    $ pynt echo[hello,world,foo=bar,blah=123]
    [ example.py - Starting task "echo" ]
    ('hello', 'world')
    {'blah': '123', 'foo': 'bar'}
    [ example.py - Completed task "echo" ]

**Organizing build scripts**
----------------------------

You can break up your build files into modules and simple import them
into your main build file.

::

    from deploy_tasks import *
    from test_tasks import functional_tests, report_coverage

------------------
* Enabling extensions

0.8.0 - 02/09/2013
------------------
* Support for specifying a default task with __DEFAULT__ variable
* pynt -v (--version) for displays version info
* pynt -l lists tasks in alphabetical order

0.7.1 - 17/03/2013
------------------
* Migrated pynt to work on python 3.x. pynt still works on 2.7.
* pynt version now displayed as part of help output.

0.7.0 - 16/02/2013
------------------

* New commandline interface. Distribution now includes 'pynt' executable.

------------------

* Simplified ignoring tasks. ignore a keyword param for task and not a separate decorator. [This change is NOT backward compatible!!!]

------------------

* Ability to pass params to tasks.
* Major rewrite and flattening the package hierarchy.

------------------

* Added progress tracking output.
* Added handling of exceptions within tasks.
